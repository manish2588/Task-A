# Card Animation Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an interactive card animation triggered by a **long click** followed by **upward mouse movement**.

## Setup Instructions

 **Clone the repository**:
   1.git clone https://github.com/manish2588/Task-A.git
   2.open the index.html file in your browser

## Technology Choices and Rationale

### HTML
Used to structure the content of the webpage, creating the foundational layout for the cards.

### CSS
Styling the layout, positioning, and colors. It provides animations and transitions for the card effects.

### JavaScript
Handles tracking of mouse movement and adds dynamic behaviors, such as triggering animations based on mouse events on the card.

## Known Limitations/Trade-offs
 1. The card layout may not display properly on smaller screens.
 2. The animation currently relies on mouse events, which may not work as expected on touch devices.

## Future Improvements
 1. Implement media queries to adapt the layout and animations for smaller screens.
 2. Work on CSS for a more attractive design and smoother animations
 3. Ensure the animation triggers on touch devices as well, by adding support for touch events.
